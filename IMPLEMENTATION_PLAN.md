## Range Selector (in-SVG, RANGE mode)

### Done
- ✅ Tech-debt: percussion coarse style → presets. BASIC/STANDARD/FULL set
  `enabledPads` (single source for "which drums"). `RangeStaffOverlay` +
  `applyPercussionPreset`.
- ✅ CR1 — Range edit ⇄ settings overlay mutually exclusive. Opening one closes
  the other; clicking empty sheet in range mode closes range edit.
  (`App.handleToggleRangeEdit`, close-on-settings effect, `handleSheetMusicClick`.)
- ✅ CR2 — Clef ↔ range coupled. `SheetMusic.computeRangeFrame(clef)` →
  `{rowLow,rowHigh,presets[]}` follows the CLEF SHOWN, not the staff slot. Bass
  clef on top staff ⇒ bass notes/presets; vocal clefs ⇒ vocal voices.
- ✅ Debug hit boxes for all interactive overlay regions (CLAUDE.md §3a).

### Current CR batch
- ✅ CR3 — Restored the "original" (wider) note set: melodic extent = FULL ±1
  octave again (room exists on ≥800px; narrow-screen scaling is ⏳).
- ✅ CR4 — Diagonal hit band: replaced the full-height rect per staff with a
  parallelogram `<polygon>` following the note row (treble/bass no longer
  overlap). Percussion → per-pad boxes centred on each pad's Y (`PERC_HIT_H`).
- ✅ CR5 — Removed text by the range setter: melodic + percussion presets are now
  bracket-only. *(Mode indicator "◆ RANGE SELECTOR" kept — confirm if it should
  go too.)*
- ✅ CR6 — Vocal centring: `computeRangeFrame` centres the clef's default voice
  (pad ±voice-span). **Verify visually with Han.**

### Backlog / next phase
- 🔨 FR — **Klavier (keyboard) range setter** (building, answers 2026-05-31).
  Context-bound & per-keyboard (treble-setter at treble kbd, bass at bass).
  Decisions: (1) range-edit shows a boundary-relative WINDOW with context keys
  beyond min/max; band = selection, drag-handles + tap-to-set-nearest, release
  re-anchors → extend up to A0–C8; (2) drag-handles AND tap (mirror bladmuziek);
  (3) REPLACE the RangeControls steppers with the graphical setter + preset
  BUTTONS; (4) scope = treble + bass (shared PianoView); percussion later.
  Reuse the boundary-relative window logic + clampRange write path.
- ✅ FR — **Boundary-relative window + balance + diagonal ellipsis (sheet music).**
  `buildRangeRow` now shows a WINDOW with 3 naturals beyond each boundary (capped
  A0–C8) → symmetric by construction (fixes 5-1-2 imbalance) AND lets you drag a
  boundary past the old ±8va limit (release re-anchors, reveals fresh context;
  subsumes the "extreme range" FR). When still cramped, collapses the in-band
  middle into a diagonal "…" keeping 3 inside each boundary. Whole layout freezes
  during drag. `MAX_NOTE_WIDTH` caps sparse spacing. **Verify visually.**
- 🔨 FR — **Keyboard range setter v2 — SPLIT layout (Han 2026-05-31).** Redesign:
  (top→bottom) preset BLOKHAKEN (brackets, no text, consistent w/ sheet) → COMPACT
  windowed SELECTOR keyboard (width-adaptive: ~20px/white key, e.g. 300px→15 keys,
  symmetric around the selection like the sheet) → REAL playable keyboard limited
  to the selection (shows the impact). Selector: band + handles + tap, freeze
  during drag, re-anchor on release. Shares windowNaturals + applyRangeBoundary.
  v1 started; preset-bracket alignment to selector keys is approximate.
- ⏳ FR — **Extreme range** up to 15mb–15ma (capped A0–C8); interaction idea:
  after releasing the drag, 3 more notes appear left & right (progressive reveal).
  Likely pairs with the ellipsis windowing.
- ✅ FR (range-selector polish v2, Han 2026-05-31) — **Verify visually.**
  1. In-band (selected) notes follow note-coloring (previewMode off + live
     coloring props); boundary notes stay YELLOW handles; out-of-band dimmed.
  2. Treble/bass hit zones: taller, cover 8va/8vb, outer edge follows note row
     −BAND_COVER, inner edge = shared divider (midpoint of the two note rows) so
     they meet EXACTLY; solo staff → symmetric BAND_SOLO_H.
  3. Percussion hit boxes taller (PERC_HIT_H) + biased UPWARD over the stems.
- 🐞/⏳ Backlog — **Drum-notation stems**: adjust stem direction/length.

### Broader app-IA redesign (mockup 2026-05-31) — LOGGED, not scheduled
Full navigation/settings vision from the wireframe. Captured for later; recommend
finishing the range-setter feature (sheet + keyboard) before opening this. Items:
clef picker (clefs slide from left, per-bar clef select incl. disable; percussion
chord vs two-melody notation); "Exercise" settings (difficulty/level-up);
"Visualisation" (note coloring, animation, multi-line, theme); Instrument setting;
"Advanced song generation" (#measures, #repeats, playback, odd/even volume); Scale
selector (bottom view); Header (melody type/key/scale, playback, scoring, settings
nav); NAV (icon main-cat ↔ sub-cat: Input|instrument, Settings|profiel,
Muziek|Toonladder).

## Conventions added this session
- CLAUDE.md §3a — every interactive component must draw its hit box in
  `debugMode` (orange rect, `pointerEvents:'none'`).
- CLAUDE.md §1a addendum — log all plans/CRs/FRs/bugs into this file immediately.
