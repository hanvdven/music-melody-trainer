# Implementation Plan — live log

> Standing rule (Han 2026-05-31): log **every** plan, CR (change request), FR
> (feature request) and bug here **immediately**, as a short implementation plan,

## Range Selector (in-SVG, RANGE mode)

### Done
- ✅ Tech-debt: percussion coarse style → presets. BASIC/STANDARD/FULL set
  `enabledPads` (single source for "which drums"). `RangeStaffOverlay` +
  `applyPercussionPreset`.
- ✅ CR1 — Range edit ⇄ settings overlay mutually exclusive. Opening one closes
  the other; clicking empty sheet in range mode closes range edit.
  (`App.handleToggleRangeEdit`, close-on-settings effect, `handleSheetMusicClick`.)
- ✅ CR2 — Clef ↔ range coupled. `SheetMusic.computeRangeFrame(clef)` →
  `{rowLow,rowHigh,presets[]}` follows the CLEF SHOWN, not the staff slot. Bass
  clef on top staff ⇒ bass notes/presets; vocal clefs ⇒ vocal voices.
- ✅ Debug hit boxes for all interactive overlay regions (CLAUDE.md §3a).

### Current CR batch
- ✅ CR3 — Restored the "original" (wider) note set: melodic extent = FULL ±1
  octave again (room exists on ≥800px; narrow-screen scaling is ⏳).
- ✅ CR4 — Diagonal hit band: replaced the full-height rect per staff with a
  parallelogram `<polygon>` following the note row (treble/bass no longer
  overlap). Percussion → per-pad boxes centred on each pad's Y (`PERC_HIT_H`).
- ✅ CR5 — Removed text by the range setter: melodic + percussion presets are now
  bracket-only. *(Mode indicator "◆ RANGE SELECTOR" kept — confirm if it should
  go too.)*
- ✅ CR6 — Vocal centring: `computeRangeFrame` centres the clef's default voice
  (pad ±voice-span). **Verify visually with Han.**

### Backlog / next phase
- 🔨 FR — **Klavier (keyboard) range setter** (design phase, mockup received
  2026-05-31). In RANGE mode, show a range setter on top of the piano too (mirror
  of the sheet-music one), both live-bound to the same state. Per-clef coloured
  key-bands with ↔ drag handles at min/max; preset **buttons** on top (bordered
  for button-feel). Responsive: large screen shows keys ±3 beyond range (or full
  if it fits); small screen "takes out the middle" with an ellipsis. Reuse
  `computeRangeFrame` + the range-edit write path (extract to shared util/hook,
  §6c). Percussion-in-keyboard = open question. *Interview before building.*
- ⏳ FR — Narrow screens: render an **ellipsis (…) between notes** when the row is
  too tight (sheet-music setter) — unify with the keyboard "take out middle".
- ⏳ FR — **Extreme range** up to 15mb–15ma (capped A0–C8); interaction idea:
  after releasing the drag, 3 more notes appear left & right (progressive reveal).
- 🐞/⏳ Backlog — **Drum-notation stems**: adjust stem direction/length.

### Broader app-IA redesign (mockup 2026-05-31) — LOGGED, not scheduled
Full navigation/settings vision from the wireframe. Captured for later; recommend
finishing the range-setter feature (sheet + keyboard) before opening this. Items:
clef picker (clefs slide from left, per-bar clef select incl. disable; percussion
chord vs two-melody notation); "Exercise" settings (difficulty/level-up);
"Visualisation" (note coloring, animation, multi-line, theme); Instrument setting;
"Advanced song generation" (#measures, #repeats, playback, odd/even volume); Scale
selector (bottom view); Header (melody type/key/scale, playback, scoring, settings
nav); NAV (icon main-cat ↔ sub-cat: Input|instrument, Settings|profiel,
Muziek|Toonladder).

## Conventions added this session
- CLAUDE.md §3a — every interactive component must draw its hit box in
  `debugMode` (orange rect, `pointerEvents:'none'`).
- CLAUDE.md §1a addendum — log all plans/CRs/FRs/bugs into this file immediately.
