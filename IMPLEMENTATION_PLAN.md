# Implementation Plan — live log

> Standing rule (Han 2026-05-31): log **every** plan, CR (change request), FR
> (feature request) and bug here **immediately**, as a short implementation plan,
> before/while implementing. This file is the running scratch-plan; BACKLOG.md

## Range Selector (in-SVG, RANGE mode)

### Done
- ✅ Tech-debt: percussion coarse style → presets. BASIC/STANDARD/FULL set
  `enabledPads` (single source for "which drums"). `RangeStaffOverlay` +
  `applyPercussionPreset`.
- ✅ CR1 — Range edit ⇄ settings overlay mutually exclusive. Opening one closes
  the other; clicking empty sheet in range mode closes range edit.
  (`App.handleToggleRangeEdit`, close-on-settings effect, `handleSheetMusicClick`.)
- ✅ CR2 — Clef ↔ range coupled. `SheetMusic.computeRangeFrame(clef)` →
  `{rowLow,rowHigh,presets[]}` follows the CLEF SHOWN, not the staff slot. Bass
  clef on top staff ⇒ bass notes/presets; vocal clefs ⇒ vocal voices.
- ✅ Debug hit boxes for all interactive overlay regions (CLAUDE.md §3a).

### Current CR batch
- ✅ CR3 — Restored the "original" (wider) note set: melodic extent = FULL ±1
  octave again (room exists on ≥800px; narrow-screen scaling is ⏳).
- ✅ CR4 — Diagonal hit band: replaced the full-height rect per staff with a
  parallelogram `<polygon>` following the note row (treble/bass no longer
  overlap). Percussion → per-pad boxes centred on each pad's Y (`PERC_HIT_H`).
- ✅ CR5 — Removed text by the range setter: melodic + percussion presets are now
  bracket-only. *(Mode indicator "◆ RANGE SELECTOR" kept — confirm if it should
  go too.)*
- ✅ CR6 — Vocal centring: `computeRangeFrame` centres the clef's default voice
  (pad ±voice-span). **Verify visually with Han.**

### Backlog / next phase
- ⏳ FR — Narrow screens: render an **ellipsis (…) between notes** when the row
  is too tight to show all noteheads.
- ⏳ FR — **Extreme range** selection up to 15mb–15ma (i.e. extend the selectable
  extent), capped at A0–C8. Interaction idea: after releasing the drag button, 3
  more notes appear on the left and right (progressive reveal).
- ⏳ FR — **Klavier (keyboard) range setter** — alternative range UI on a piano
  keyboard. Needs the reference image from Han (to be re-shared).
- 🐞/⏳ Backlog — **Drum-notation stems**: adjust stem direction/length in the
  percussion notation.

## Conventions added this session
- CLAUDE.md §3a — every interactive component must draw its hit box in
  `debugMode` (orange rect, `pointerEvents:'none'`).
- CLAUDE.md §1a addendum — log all plans/CRs/FRs/bugs into this file immediately.
